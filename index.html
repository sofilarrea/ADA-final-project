                <p> My life has revolved around dentistry for 15 years, but I always felt that there was something wrong with it, like a splinter in my mind. The first time I discovered programming, I felt like Alice falling down the rabbit hole, unveiling a wonderful world filled with amazing people I aspire to work with. The desire to be an active part of this world, <em>to make a difference</em>, became the catalyst for a significant shift in my career. <br> <strong>so I change and start again ..</strong></p>

                    <p>My life, shaped by motherhood and a passion for rescuing overlooked older dogs, took an unexpected turn from dentistry to programming. Juggling the responsibilities of raising two children, I found immense fulfillment in providing a loving home for senior canine companions. Despite the security of my dental career, the allure of coding proved irresistible, prompting a courageous leap into a new professional realm.</p>
